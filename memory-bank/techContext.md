# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **Go**: Primary programming language
- **Standard Library**: Used for networking, file I/O, and concurrency
- **JSON**: Used for player data persistence
- **Telnet**: Protocol for client connections

## Development Setup
- Go development environment
- Text editor or IDE with Go support
- Telnet client for testing

## Technical Constraints
- Maintain compatibility with original DikuMUD data files
- Support telnet protocol for client connections
- Ensure performance with multiple concurrent users

## Dependencies
- Go standard library
- No external dependencies for core functionality

## Build and Run
```bash
# Build the project
go build -o dikugo cmd/dikugo/main.go

# Run the server
./dikugo
```

## Project Structure
- `cmd/`: Entry points for executables
- `pkg/`: Core packages
  - `ai/`: AI behaviors for NPCs
  - `combat/`: Combat system implementation
  - `command/`: Command processing
  - `config/`: Configuration handling
  - `game/`: Main game logic
  - `network/`: Network communication
  - `storage/`: Data loading and saving
  - `types/`: Common type definitions
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
  - `world/`: World simulation

## Data Files
- Original DikuMUD data files are used for world definition
- Player data is stored in JSON format
- Configuration is loaded from YAML files
