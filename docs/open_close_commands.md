# Open and Close Commands Implementation

## Overview

I have implemented the `open` and `close` commands following the original DikuMUD mechanics exactly. These commands work on both containers (held or in room) and doors/exits, with proper state management, two-way door synchronization, and correct exit visibility handling.

## Commands Implemented

### 1. **Open Command**
Opens containers and doors that are currently closed.

**Usage**: 
- `open <container>` - Opens a container in inventory or room
- `open <door>` - Opens a door by keyword
- `open <door> <direction>` - Opens a specific door in a direction

**Original DikuMUD Behavior**:
- Searches inventory first, then room objects, then doors
- Handles container flags: CLOSEABLE, CLOSED, LOCKED
- Handles door flags: EX_ISDOOR, EX_CLOSED, EX_LOCKED
- Opens both sides of doors automatically
- Sends appropriate messages to character and room

### 2. **Close Command**
Closes containers and doors that are currently open.

**Usage**:
- `close <container>` - Closes a container in inventory or room
- `close <door>` - Closes a door by keyword
- `close <door> <direction>` - Closes a specific door in a direction

**Original DikuMUD Behavior**:
- Same search priority as open command
- Validates container and door states before closing
- Closes both sides of doors automatically
- Sends appropriate messages to character and room

## Technical Implementation

### Container Mechanics

**Container Flags** (from `obj.Prototype.Value[1]`):
- `CONT_CLOSEABLE` (1): Container can be opened/closed
- `CONT_PICKPROOF` (2): Container cannot be picked
- `CONT_CLOSED` (4): Container is currently closed
- `CONT_LOCKED` (8): Container is currently locked

**Container State Validation**:
```go
// Open container checks
if container.Prototype.Type != types.ITEM_CONTAINER {
    return "That's not a container."
}
if (container.Prototype.Value[1] & types.CONT_CLOSED) == 0 {
    return "But it's already open!"
}
if (container.Prototype.Value[1] & types.CONT_CLOSEABLE) == 0 {
    return "You can't do that."
}
if (container.Prototype.Value[1] & types.CONT_LOCKED) != 0 {
    return "It seems to be locked."
}
```

**Container State Changes**:
- **Open**: `container.Value[1] &^= types.CONT_CLOSED` (remove CLOSED flag)
- **Close**: `container.Value[1] |= types.CONT_CLOSED` (add CLOSED flag)

### Door Mechanics

**Exit Flags** (from `exit.Flags`):
- `EX_ISDOOR` (1): Exit is a door that can be opened/closed
- `EX_CLOSED` (2): Door is currently closed
- `EX_LOCKED` (4): Door is currently locked
- `EX_PICKPROOF` (8): Door cannot be picked

**Door State Validation**:
```go
// Open door checks
if (exit.Flags & types.EX_ISDOOR) == 0 {
    return "That's impossible, I'm afraid."
}
if (exit.Flags & types.EX_CLOSED) == 0 {
    return "It's already open!"
}
if (exit.Flags & types.EX_LOCKED) != 0 {
    return "It seems to be locked."
}
```

**Door State Changes**:
- **Open**: `exit.Flags &^= types.EX_CLOSED` (remove CLOSED flag)
- **Close**: `exit.Flags |= types.EX_CLOSED` (add CLOSED flag)

### Two-Way Door Synchronization

**Automatic Other Side Updates**:
1. Find destination room using `exit.DestVnum`
2. Calculate reverse direction (north ↔ south, east ↔ west, up ↔ down)
3. Verify reverse exit leads back to current room
4. Apply same state change to reverse exit
5. Send appropriate message to destination room

**Reverse Direction Mapping**:
```go
func getReverseDirection(dir int) int {
    switch dir {
    case types.DIR_NORTH: return types.DIR_SOUTH
    case types.DIR_EAST:  return types.DIR_WEST
    case types.DIR_SOUTH: return types.DIR_NORTH
    case types.DIR_WEST:  return types.DIR_EAST
    case types.DIR_UP:    return types.DIR_DOWN
    case types.DIR_DOWN:  return types.DIR_UP
    }
}
```

### Search Priority and Object Finding

**Search Order**:
1. **Inventory**: Check character's carried items first
2. **Room Objects**: Check objects in the current room
3. **Doors/Exits**: Check room exits by keyword or direction

**Name Matching**:
- **Containers**: Match against `obj.Prototype.Name` and `obj.Prototype.ShortDesc`
- **Doors**: Match against `exit.Keywords` or default "door"
- **Case Insensitive**: All matching is case-insensitive
- **Partial Match**: Uses `strings.Contains()` for flexible matching

**Direction Parsing**:
- Full names: "north", "east", "south", "west", "up", "down"
- Abbreviations: "n", "e", "s", "w", "u", "d"
- Case insensitive matching

## Message System

### Success Messages

**Container Operations**:
- To character: "Ok.\r\n"
- To room: "{Character} opens {container}." / "{Character} closes {container}."

**Door Operations**:
- To character: "Ok.\r\n"
- To room: "{Character} opens the {door}." / "{Character} closes the {door}."
- To other side: "The {door} is opened from the other side." / "The {door} closes quietly."

### Error Messages

**Container Errors**:
- "That's not a container."
- "But it's already open!" / "But it's already closed!"
- "You can't do that." (not closeable)
- "That's impossible." (not closeable for close)
- "It seems to be locked."

**Door Errors**:
- "That's impossible, I'm afraid." (not a door for open)
- "That's absurd." (not a door for close)
- "It's already open!" / "It's already closed!"
- "It seems to be locked."

**General Errors**:
- "Open what?" / "Close what?" (no arguments)
- "I see no {object} here." (object not found)

## Original DikuMUD Compatibility

### Exact Message Format
All messages match the original DikuMUD exactly:
- "Ok." (success)
- "That's not a container."
- "But it's already open!"
- "You can't do that."
- "It seems to be locked."
- "That's impossible, I'm afraid."
- "That's absurd."

### Mechanics Fidelity
- **Flag Operations**: Uses exact bitwise operations from original C code
- **Search Priority**: Inventory → Room Objects → Doors (same as original)
- **Two-Way Doors**: Automatic synchronization of both sides
- **State Validation**: All original validation checks implemented
- **Error Handling**: Identical error conditions and messages

### Integration Points
- **Container System**: Works with existing ITEM_CONTAINER objects
- **Exit System**: Works with existing room exit structure
- **Flag System**: Uses existing CONT_* and EX_* flag constants
- **Message System**: Integrates with character.SendMessage()
- **World Interface**: Uses GetRoom() for door synchronization

## Usage Examples

### Opening Containers
```
> open chest
Ok.
> open chest
But it's already open!
> open locked_box
It seems to be locked.
```

### Closing Containers
```
> close chest
Ok.
> close chest
But it's already closed!
```

### Opening Doors
```
> open door
Ok.
> open door north
Ok.
> open gate
Ok.
```

### Closing Doors
```
> close door
Ok.
> close gate south
Ok.
```

### Error Cases
```
> open sword
That's not a container.
> open nonexistent
I see no nonexistent here.
> open
Open what?
```

## Key Fixes Applied

### 🔧 **Exit Visibility Fix**
Fixed the room display to only show exits that are not closed doors, following the original DikuMUD behavior:
- **Before**: All exits were shown regardless of door state
- **After**: Only open exits are displayed in room descriptions
- **Implementation**: Added `!exit.IsClosed()` check in look and movement commands

### 🎯 **Argument Parsing Fix**
Implemented proper argument parsing following the original DikuMUD `argument_interpreter` logic:
- **Object Search**: Uses full argument string for container finding (like `generic_find`)
- **Door Search**: Parses arguments into object name and direction
- **Fill Word Handling**: Skips words like "the", "a", "an", "to", "from", etc.
- **Direction Support**: Properly handles "door north", "gate west", etc.

### 🚪 **Door Keyword Matching**
Enhanced door finding to match original DikuMUD `find_door` and `isname` functions:
- **Keyword Matching**: Supports multiple keywords per door
- **Prefix Matching**: Allows partial keyword matches
- **Direction Priority**: When direction specified, checks that specific exit first
- **Fallback Logic**: Searches all exits when no direction given

### 🏗️ **Door Flag Parsing Fix**
Fixed the critical issue where door flags weren't being set properly during world loading:
- **Before**: Raw door flags (0, 1, 2) were stored directly, not converted to EX_ISDOOR flags
- **After**: Proper flag conversion following original DikuMUD logic:
  - `0` = no door (no flags)
  - `1` = door (EX_ISDOOR flag)
  - `2` = pickproof door (EX_ISDOOR | EX_PICKPROOF flags)
- **Implementation**: Fixed `pkg/storage/room_parser.go` to convert door flags correctly

### 🔄 **Zone Reset Door Handling**
Implemented the missing `resetDoor` function for proper door state management:
- **Door State Control**: Handles zone reset 'D' commands to set door states
- **State Options**:
  - `0` = open (remove CLOSED and LOCKED flags)
  - `1` = closed (set CLOSED, remove LOCKED)
  - `2` = locked (set CLOSED and LOCKED flags)
- **Two-Way Synchronization**: Automatically updates both sides of doors
- **Implementation**: Added complete `resetDoor` function in `pkg/world/zone_reset.go`
