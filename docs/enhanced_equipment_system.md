# Enhanced Equipment System

## Overview

The DikuGo equipment system has been enhanced to provide better handling of equipment commands, following the original DikuMUD mechanics more closely while adding quality-of-life improvements.

## New Commands

### ü§≤ **Hold Command**

The `hold` command allows players to hold items in their hands, with special handling for light sources.

**Usage:**
```
hold <item>
grab <item>  (alias)
```

**Features:**
- **Light Sources**: Automatically detects `ITEM_LIGHT` objects and places them in the `WEAR_LIGHT` position
- **Holdable Items**: Places items with `ITEM_WEAR_HOLD` flag in the `WEAR_HOLD` position
- **Class Restrictions**: Respects class-based item restrictions
- **Alignment Checks**: Handles anti-alignment items (zapping effect)

**Examples:**
```
> hold torch
Ok.
(Torch goes to WEAR_LIGHT position)

> hold wand
Ok.
(Wand goes to WEAR_HOLD position)

> hold sword
You can't hold a long sword.
(Swords can't be held, only wielded)
```

### ‚öîÔ∏è **Wield Command**

The `wield` command is specifically for wielding weapons, separate from the general wear command.

**Usage:**
```
wield <weapon>
```

**Features:**
- **Weapon-Specific**: Only works with items that have `ITEM_WEAR_WIELD` flag
- **Class Restrictions**: Respects weapon restrictions (e.g., clerics can't use edged weapons)
- **Strength Checks**: Future enhancement for weapon weight requirements
- **Alignment Checks**: Handles anti-alignment weapons

**Examples:**
```
> wield sword
Ok.

> wield dagger
Ok.

> wield shield
You can't wield a wooden shield.
(Shields are worn, not wielded)
```

## Enhanced Wear Command

### üîÑ **Multiple Position Support**

The wear command now intelligently handles items that can be worn in multiple positions, following the original DikuMUD behavior.

**Finger Items:**
- First ring goes to left finger (`WEAR_FINGER_L`)
- Second ring goes to right finger (`WEAR_FINGER_R`)
- Provides specific messages: "You put the ring on your left finger."

**Wrist Items:**
- First bracelet goes to left wrist (`WEAR_WRIST_L`)
- Second bracelet goes to right wrist (`WEAR_WRIST_R`)
- Provides specific messages: "You wear the bracelet around your left wrist."

**Neck Items:**
- First necklace goes to first neck position (`WEAR_NECK_1`)
- Second necklace goes to second neck position (`WEAR_NECK_2`)
- Uses simple "Ok." message like original DikuMUD

### üì¶ **Enhanced "Wear All"**

The `wear all` command has been improved to iterate through inventory more intelligently:

**Features:**
- **Smart Position Selection**: Uses `findBestWearPosition()` to find optimal positions
- **Multiple Position Handling**: Properly handles rings, bracelets, and necklaces
- **Class Restrictions**: Skips items the character can't use
- **Alignment Checks**: Skips items that would zap the character
- **Detailed Feedback**: Shows exactly what was worn and where

**Example:**
```
> wear all
You put the gold ring on your left finger.
You put the silver ring on your right finger.
You wear the leather bracelet around your left wrist.
You wear the chain mail on your body.
You wear the iron helmet on your head.
```

## Position-Specific Messages

### üéØ **Authentic DikuMUD Messages**

The system now provides position-specific messages that match the original DikuMUD:

| Position | Message Format |
|----------|----------------|
| Left Finger | "You put [item] on your left finger." |
| Right Finger | "You put [item] on your right finger." |
| Left Wrist | "You wear [item] around your left wrist." |
| Right Wrist | "You wear [item] around your right wrist." |
| Neck | "Ok." |
| Shield | "You start using [item]." |
| Other | "You wear [item] on your [position]." |
