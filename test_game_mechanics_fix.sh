echo "=== Manual Testing Instructions ==="
echo "To test these fixes manually:"
echo "1. Start the server: ./dikugo"
echo "2. Connect and create a character"
echo "3. Test drink command:"
echo "   - Find a fountain and type: drink fountain"
echo "   - Get a drink container and type: drink <container>"
echo "4. Test container access:"
echo "   - Kill a mob to create a corpse"
echo "   - Type: get all from corpse"
echo "   - Find other containers and try: get <item> from <container>"
echo "5. Test pet shop:"
echo "   - Go to a pet shop room"
echo "   - Type: list (to see available pets)"
echo "   - Type: buy <pet> (to purchase a pet)"
echo
echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- Drink command should work with fountains and drink containers"
echo "- Container access should work with corpses and other containers"
echo "- Pet shop should show available pets and allow purchases"
