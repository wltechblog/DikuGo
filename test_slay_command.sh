echo "- Comprehensive error handling"
echo "- Integration with existing death and experience systems"

echo "✓ Uses normal battle mechanics (not bypassing functions)"
echo "✓ Delivers target's full HP worth of damage in single hit"
echo "✓ Awards experience points through normal combat system"
echo "✓ Handles character death through existing HandleCharacterDeath"
echo "✓ Admin-only command (level 20+ required)"
echo "✓ Proper error messages for all edge cases"
echo "✓ Logged for admin oversight"
